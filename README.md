# 🎼 **MelodyMind: Hybrid Music Recommendation System** 🎧  


Welcome to the MelodyMind project repository! This project implements a hybrid music recommendation system that combines the power of **Content-Based Filtering** and **Collaborative Filtering** using the **LightFM** library.

The goal is to provide personalized song recommendations by leveraging both the intrinsic features of the music itself and patterns derived from user interactions (simulated in this project by treating artists as users).

## ✨ Features

* **Hybrid Approach:** Combines Content-Based and Collaborative Filtering for potentially more accurate and diverse recommendations.

* **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommends songs based on audio features (danceability, energy, etc.) using cosine similarity.

* **Collaborative Filtering:** Utilizes the LightFM library to learn user (artist) and item (track) embeddings from interaction data.

* **Simulated User Interactions:** Demonstrates collaborative filtering using artist-track associations as implicit feedback.

* **Streamlit Web App:** Provides an interactive web interface to get recommendations.

* **Modular Design:** Project components are separated (data loading/cleaning/training in a notebook, deployment in a separate script).

## 💡 Concepts Explained

* **Content-Based Filtering:** Imagine recommending songs that *sound* similar to what you already like. This method analyzes the characteristics (features) of items (songs) and suggests others with similar characteristics.

* **Collaborative Filtering:** This method looks at the behavior of many users. If User A and User B like similar songs, and User A likes a song that User B hasn't heard, Collaborative Filtering might recommend that song to User B. It finds patterns in user-item interactions.

* **Hybrid System:** By combining Content-Based and Collaborative Filtering, the system can overcome limitations of each method. For example, it can recommend new or niche songs (Content-Based) and also leverage the collective intelligence of users (Collaborative Filtering).


## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.7+

* Git (for cloning the repository)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your-github-repo-url>
    cd MelodyMind

    ```

    *(Replace `<your-github-repo-url>` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository)*

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv

    ```

3.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**

    * On Windows:

        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate

        ```

    * On macOS and Linux:

        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate

        ```

4.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    ```

### Data

The project uses the "Spotify Dataset 1921-2020, 160k+ Tracks" dataset available on Kaggle by Yamaç Eren Ay.

* **Dataset Source:** <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks>


### Running the Notebook

The `notebook/Hybrid_Music_Recommendation_System.ipynb` notebook contains the full workflow from data loading and cleaning to model training and saving.

1.  Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed (`pip install notebook` or `pip install jupyterlab`).

2.  Navigate to the `notebook/` directory in your terminal.

3.  Start the notebook server:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    # or
    jupyter lab

    ```

4.  Open `Hybrid_Music_Recommendation_System.ipynb` in your browser.

5.  Run all cells sequentially. This will train the LightFM model and generate the `music_recommender_components.pkl` file in the `/kaggle/working/` directory (if running on Kaggle) or the notebook's directory. **You need this `.pkl` file for the Streamlit app.**

### Running the Streamlit App

Once you have generated the `music_recommender_components.pkl` file and placed it in the same directory as `app.py` and `requirements.txt`:

1.  Ensure your virtual environment is activated.

2.  Navigate to the root directory of the repository (where `app.py` is located).

3.  Run the Streamlit app:

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py

    ```

4.  Your web browser will open, displaying the interactive music recommendation application.

## 📈 Potential Improvements

* **Real User Data:** Integrate with a real music service API (like Spotify API) to use actual user listening history and provide more personalized recommendations.

* **More Features:** Include additional features like genre, lyrics, or external music tags.

* **Advanced Models:** Experiment with other recommendation algorithms (e.g., Matrix Factorization variants, deep learning models).

* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimize LightFM parameters for better performance.

* **Evaluation Metrics:** Implement more comprehensive evaluation metrics and use a proper train-test split for the collaborative filtering part.

* **Scalability:** Consider how to scale the system for larger datasets and more users.

* **User Interface:** Enhance the Streamlit UI with more features, better styling, and potentially audio previews.

## 🚀 **Project Overview** 
**MelodyMind** is a simple **AI-driven music recommendation system** offering two different approaches:  

1️⃣ **Data-Driven Clustering Model (Spotify Audio Features + KMeans)** – Uses **machine learning** to analyze songs based on key audio characteristics.

2️⃣ **Real-Time API-Based Recommendation (Last.fm API + Streamlit)** – Fetches similar songs dynamically based on user input.  

This project combines **machine learning** with **real-time song discovery**, delivering **personalized, interactive, and efficient music recommendations**.
